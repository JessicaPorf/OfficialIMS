# ProjectIMS

This is a project on Inventory Management Systems. It is a software system for tracking inventory items, orders and customers. I have included a Risk Assesment, pom.xml file and this README for the project.

## Getting Started

The live database I have used is Google Cloud Platform (GCP) with a MySQL server. You are able to run it via anyones machine.

## Prerequisites

I needed to install Java, Maven and MySQL. I had these on my localinstall however they are avaliable to download online.

## Running the tests

I had to push it to sonarqube to access the coverage results of a single test.
There are Maven integration tests.
Semantic Testing belongs among validation tests, with which the validity of the data input is tested. 

I used Mockito to help run my tests, it is a mocking framework. A Java based library that is used for effective unit testing of Java applications. Mockito is used to mock interfaces so that a dummy functionality can be added to a mock interface that can be used in unit testing. 

## Deployment

I have one major release, however I have pushed multiple versions of my IMS each one slightly more improved than the previous. This was me working in an Agile way. Having a quick release framework allows me to push the MVP out to customers as soon as possible. Which allows time for feedback and further improvemnt in upcoming releases.
